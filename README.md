**Description:**
This project is a beginner-friendly tutorial for working with Web3.js, focusing on integrating Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and the Solana Web3.js module to create a simple web application. It demonstrates how to connect to Solana's Testnet and Devnet RPC networks to interact with the Solana blockchain.

**Requirements:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS
- Solana Web3.js module
- Solana Testnet and Devnet RPC endpoints
